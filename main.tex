\section*{Abstract}
Host phenology is an important driver of parasite transmission and evolution. In a seasonal environment, monocyclic, obligate-killer parasites evolve optimal virulence strategies such that all parasite progeny are released near the end of the host season to limit parasite progeny death in the environment. It is unclear whether host seasonality imposes different constraints on polycyclic parasites such that both polycyclic and monocyclic parasites are maintained. We develop a mathematical model of a disease system with seasonal host activity to study the evolutionary consequences of host phenology on polycyclic, obligate-killer parasite virulence strategies. Seasonal host activity patterns create both monocyclic and polycyclic parasite evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) separated by less-fit strategies (evolutionary repellors). The ESS that evolves in each system is a function of the virulence strategy of the parasite introduced into the system. The trait value for both monocyclic and polycyclic strategies is determined by two aspects of host phenology: the duration of the host activity period and the distribution in the time at which hosts first become active within each season. Longer host activity periods and more synchronous host emergence drive both the monocyclic and polycyclic strategies towards lower virulence. The results demonstrate that host phenology can, in theory, maintain diverse parasite strategies among isolated geographic locations.




\section*{Introduction}
Classic ecological theory predicts that seasonality creates niche space when species compete for a shared resource. In an equilibrial environment, k-selected species mature slowly but are efficient at collecting resources as adults and outcompete r-selected species who mature quickly but are poor competitors for resources\cite{tilman2020resource}. Fluctuating resources in seasonal environments create niche space such that k-selected species who are better competitors when resources are scarce, can coexist with r-selected species, who reproduce quickly when density is low but resources are abundant\cite{koch1974competitive,armstrong1980competitive,litchman2001competition,klausmeier2008floquet}. Evidence for whether seasonality impacts the vast diversity of parasite strategies in nature remains equivocal.

Some studies have found that seasonality generates parasite diversity for certain traits while others have been inconclusive. One of the best examples of seasonality driving parasite diversity comes from theoretical work that considered a trade-off between within-season transmission and between-season survival\cite{hamelin2011seasonality}. This study showed that seasonal host absence can create niche space such that polycyclic parasites specialized on initiating new infections within the season coexist with monocyclic parasites specialized on between-season survival. %However a study on a similar model governed by the same trade-off failed to find evidence that seasonality can drive branching\cite{van2010periodicity}.
Seasonal host reproduction has also been shown to drive covert/overt parasite infection strategies towards multiple evolutionary attractors\cite{sorrell2009evolution}. In this case, seasonality can select for parasites with a covert infection strategy that can be reactivated later in time or an overt infection strategy that is transmissible immediately. However seasonality has not been shown to impact the diversity of other parasite traits, such as virulence\cite{donnelly2013seasonality}.

%The timing of seasonal host activity, or host phenology, drives the timing and prevalence of transmission opportunities for parasites\cite{Biere1996,Altizer2006,Hamer2012,Gethings2015,Ogden2018,Martinez2018,McDevitt-Galles2020,MacDonald2020}. Host phenology also impacts parasite evolution with the majority of research focused on the evolution of parasite virulence\cite{king2009evolution,sorrell2009evolution,van2011periodic,donnelly2013seasonality}. Whether seasonality could drive parasite diversity by selecting for distinct parasite virulence strategies is unknown.

Seasonal monocyclic and polycyclic parasites likely face distinct selective pressures with regard to virulence evolution. One potential driver of the monocyclic parasite strategy is that constraints on the minimum amount of time for new parasite assembly means that parasites only have time to complete one generation of infections per season. That is, low virulence, \textit{i.e.} a long latency period between infection and new parasite release, is necessary to produce enough progeny for these parasites to persist. Recent theoretical work puts forth another explanation by demonstrating that the optimal strategy for a monocyclic, obligate host-killer parasite is low virulence so that new parasites are released near the end of the host's season. This study demonstrated that low virulence is adaptive for parasites in a seasonal environment to minimize progeny decay in the enviroment. However, if there is no explicit constraint that the parasite must be monocyclic, its unclear whether this low virulence, monocyclic strategy would remain adaptive. Intuitively, high virulence should be adaptive for polycyclic parasites to increase the number of infections within the season. Its unclear whether the different selection pressures on monocyclic and polycyclic strategies could generate diversity by making both strategies adaptive.

Here we investigate the impact of host phenology on the virulence evolution of an obligate-killer parasite with no constraints on the number of infection cycles it can complete per season. We extend a mathematical model that tracks the dynamics of a monocyclic parasite that infects a seasonally available host species to study the impacts of seasonal host activity on polycyclic parasites. We demonstrate that seasonality drives either monocyclic or polycyclic evolutionarily stable strategies to evolve for a parasite population starting from moderate virulence, \textit{i.e.} seasonality can drive bistability in virulence strategies. Further, host season length and the synchronicity at which hosts first become active during the season impact the optimal virulence level for both monocyclic and polycyclic parasites. These results demonstrate that there are multiple evolutionary solutions for parasites in seasonal environments which provides clues for the evolutionary origins of monocyclic and polycyclic parasites.

\section{Model description}
The model describes the transmission dynamics of a free-living, obligate-killer parasite that infects a seasonally available host (Figure 1). $\hat{s}(n)$ enter the system at the beginning of the season over a period given by the function $g(t,t_{l})$. Hosts, $s$, have non-overlapping generations and are alive for one season.
%The parasite, $v$, infects hosts while they are briefly susceptible early in their development (\textit{e.g.} baculoviruses of forest \textit{Lepidoptera}\cite{baltensweiler1977dynamics,woods1987biomodal,bilimoria1991biology,dwyer1993using,Dwyer1994} and univoltine insects parasitized by ichneumonids\cite{campbell1975gypsy,delucchi1982parasitoids,kenis2007natural}).
The parasite, $v$, must infect and kill the host to release new infectious progeny. The number of rounds of infection the parasite completes within a season depends on how quickly the parasite kills its host after infection. If there is a long period between infection and progeny release, the parasite is monocyclic and completes one round of infection per season. If there is a short period between infection and progeny release, the parasite is polycyclic and can complete multiple rounds of infection per season.

The initial conditions in the beginning of the season are $s(0) = 0, v(0^+) = v(0^-) = \hat{v}(n)$ where $\hat{v}(n)$ is the size of the starting parasite population introduced at the beginning of season $n$ determined by the number of parasites produced in season $n-1$. In some cases, the size of the emerging host cohort in season $n$, $\hat{s}(n)$, is constant. We also explore the impact of host carryover between seasons by assuming that $\hat{s}(n)$ is determined by the number of hosts that reproduced in season $n-1$. The transmission dynamics in season $n$ are given by the following system of delay differential equations (all parameters are described in Table 1):
\begin{align*}
&\frac{ds}{dt} = \hat{s}(n)g(t,t_{l})-ds(t)- \alpha s(t)v(t),\tag{1a}\\
&\frac{dv}{dt} = \alpha \beta e^{-d\tau} s(t-\tau)v(t-\tau)-\delta v(t).\tag{1b}
\end{align*}

\noindent where $d$ is the host death rate, $\delta$ is the decay rate of parasites in the environment, $\alpha$ is the transmission rate and $\tau$ is the delay between host infection and host death. $\tau$ is equivalent to virulence where low virulence parasites have long $\tau$ and high virulence parasites have short $\tau$. $\beta$ is the number of parasites produced upon host death. In some cases we assume that $\beta$ is constant and in other cases we assume it is a function of $\tau$, $\beta(\tau)$.

The rate of infection is density dependent such that the majority of infections occur near the beginning of the season when susceptible host and free parasite densities are high. Parasite-induced host death at time $\tau$ post-infection releases parasite progeny ($v$) into the environment where they decay in the environment from exposure at rate $\delta$. If $\tau$ is short enough, more than one generation of infections can occur within the season. Parasite progeny that survive in the environment to the end of the season comprise the parasite population that emerge in the following season ($v(T) = \hat{v}(n+1)$).

\noindent The function $g(t,t_{l})$ is a probability density function that captures the per-capita host emergence rate by specifying the timing and length of host emergence. We use a uniform distribution ($U(\bullet)$) for analytical tractability, but other distributions can be used.

 \[ g(t,t_{l}) = \begin{cases}
          \frac{1}{t_{l}} & 0 \leq t\leq t_{l} \\
          0 & t_{l}< t\leq T
       \end{cases}
    \]
$t_{l}$ denotes the length of the host emergence period and $T$ denotes the season length. The season begins ($t_{0}=0$) with the emergence of the susceptible host cohort, $\hat{s}$. The host cohort emerges from $0 \leq t\leq t_{l}.$ $\hat{s}(n)$ is either constant or a function of the number of uninfected hosts remaining in the system at $t = T$. $v$ parasites remaining in the system at $t = T$ give rise to next season's initial parasite population ($\hat{v}(n) = v(0)$). Parasites that have not killed their host by the end of the season do not release progeny. Background mortality arises from predation or some other natural cause. We assume that infected hosts that die from background mortality do not release parasites because the parasites are either consumed or the latency period corresponds to the time necessary to develop viable progeny\cite{wang2006lysis,white2011determinants}.

In previous work on a similar model we derived an analytical expression for parasite fitness as the density of parasites at the end of the season, $v(T)$\cite{macdonald2021host}. However we cannot solve system (1) in the current framework analytically, thus all results were found by performing numerical computations.

\subsubsection{Between-season dynamics}
To study the impact of the feedback between host demography and parasite fitness on parasite evolution we let the size of the emerging host cohort be a function of the number of uninfected hosts remaining at the end of the prior season
\begin{align*}
    &\hat{s}(n+1) = \frac{\sigma s(T)}{1+\rho s(T)}
\end{align*}
\noindent where $\sigma$ is host reproduction and $\rho$ is the density dependent parameter. \\

\noindent We have shown previously that host carryover generates a feedback between parasite fitness and host demography that can drive quasiperiodic dynamics for some parameter ranges\cite{}.

\subsubsection{Parasite evolution}
\noindent To study how parasite traits adapt given different seasonal host activity patterns, we use evolutionary invasion analysis\cite{metz1992should,geritz1998evolutionarily}. We first extend system (1) to follow the invasion dynamics a rare mutant parasite

\begin{align*}
&\frac{ds}{dt} = \hat{s}g(t,t_{l})- d s(t)- \alpha s(t)v(t) - \alpha_{m} s(t)v_{m}(t),\tag{2a}\\
&\frac{dv}{dt} = \alpha \beta e^{-d\tau} s(t-\tau)v(t-\tau)-\delta v(t),\tag{2b}\\
&\frac{dv_{m}}{dt} = \alpha_{m} \beta_{m} e^{-d\tau_{m}} s(t-\tau_{m})v_{m}(t-\tau_{m})-\delta_{m} v_{m}(t).\tag{2c}
\end{align*}
where $m$ subscripts refer to the invading mutant parasite and its corresponding traits.

The invasion fitness of a rare mutant parasite depends on the density of $v_{m}$ produced by the end of the season ($v_{m}(T)$) in the environment set by the resident parasite at equilibrium density $\hat{v}^*$. The mutant parasite invades in a given host phenological scenario if the density of $v_{m}$ produced by time $T$ is greater than or equal to the initial $v_{m}(0) = 1$ introduced at the start of the season ($v_{m}(T) \geq 1$).

To study the evolution of virulence traits, we first assume all other resident and mutant traits are identical (\textit{e.g.} $\alpha=\alpha_{m}$). Note that when there is no trade-off between $\beta$ and $\tau$, the parasite growth rate in the host is essentially the trait under selection. That is, $\beta$ is constant regardless of $\tau$ thus the time between infection and when the parasite kills the host and releases new parasites is the rate that $\beta$ new parasites are assembled.

In previous work on a similar model we also derived an analytical expression for mutant invasion fitness\cite{macdonald2021host}. The invasion fitness of a rare mutant parasite depends on the density of $v_{m}$ produced by the end of the season ($v_{m}(T)$) in the environment set by the resident parasite at equilibrium density $\hat{v}^*$. The mutant parasite invades in a given host phenological scenario if the density of $v_{m}$ produced by time $T$ is greater than or equal to the initial $v_{m}(0) = 1$ introduced at the start of the season ($v_{m}(T) \geq 1$). To find optimal virulence ($\tau^*$) for a given host phenological scenario, we find the uninvadable trait value numerically that satisfies

\begin{align*}
  &\evalat{\frac{\partial v_{2m}(T)}{\partial\tau_{m}}}{\tau_{m}=\tau_{r}}=0\\
  &\evalat{\frac{\partial^2v_{2m}(T)}{\partial\tau_{m}^2}}{\tau_{m}=\tau_{r}}<0
\end{align*}

When we let $s(T)$ reproduce to determine next season's host cohort $\hat{s}$, we need to conduct simulations to determine the outcome of parasite adaptation. Host carryover creates a feedback between parasite fitness and host demography that can drive cycling for some parameter ranges. When parasite-host dynamics are cycling, the density of $v_{m}(T)$ in the season the mutant was introduced does not reliably predict the outcome of parasite evolution as mutants with a selective advantage do not always invade\cite{}. We thus conduct simulations to verify that the evolutionary stable level of virulence is qualitatively the same as results when the emerging host cohort is constant each season and cycling cannot occur.

The simulation analysis was done by first numerically simulating system (1) with a monomorphic parasite population. A single mutant parasite is introduced at the beginning of the season after 100 seasons have passed. The mutant's virulence strategy is drawn from a normal distribution whose mean is the value of $\tau$ from the resident strain. System (2) is then numerically simulated with the resident and mutant parasite. New mutants arise randomly after 1000 seasons have passed since the last mutant was introduced, at which point system (2) expands to follow the dynamics of the new parasites strain. This new mutant has a virulence strategy drawn from a normal distribution whose mean is the value of $\tau$ from whichever parasite strain has the highest density. System (2) continues to expand for each new mutant randomly introduced after at least 1000 seasons have passed. Any parasite whose density falls below 1 is considered extinct and is eliminated. Virulence evolves as the population of parasites with the adaptive strategy eventually invade and rise in density. Note that our simulations deviate from the adaptive dynamics literature in that new mutants can be introduced before earlier mutants have replaced the previous resident. Previous studies have shown that this approach is well suited to predicting evolutionary outcomes\cite{kisdi1999evolutionary,white2005adaptive,white2006evolutionary}.

\section*{Results}
%seasonal host availability drives bistability in virulence optima
%fitness as measured by equilibrium density is not equivalent to invasion fitness for high virulence parasites, i.e. what makes a good invader results in adaptation towards a worse evolutionary endpoint
%phenology alters optima: (1) short seasons select for high virulence (2) slow emergence selects for high virulence
%environmental conditions impact which of the optima is the global optimum
%environmental conditions determine whether bistable optima exist or only one optimum exists
%feedback drives cycling, does not impact qualitative bistability

%p1 - How does phenology affect fitness in general (draw from last paper). Basically, parasite density at end of season is what to be maximized. Phenology does this by minimizing parasite decay in the environment and virulence determines time to burst so this interaction is the important factor. Horrible, but general idea is to quickly define how to maximize fitness in general.
%p1.1 - When there is a trade-off between time in host and parasites released, there are two ways to increase fitness. First, try to infect early and burst near end, requires a lower virulence strategy. Second, fit 2 rounds of infection by having high vir where the first bursts does not decay in the env bc immediately infect another host which bursts near end of season. Levels of virulence intermediate between these two local fitness optima are worse bc either too low of virulence to fit 2 rounds of infection such that many parasites die with their hosts and too high virulence such that released parasites must live in env for long time and decay. HM - add that higher virulence is not helpful because there are few hosts left later in the season
%P2- The direction of virulence evolution depends on what side of a local fitness minimum intermediate between the local fitness optima. With small evo step sizes, always evolve away from this local min, even if the optimum is not the global optimum. With large enough mutations, evolution to the global optimum will occur eventually.
%p3 - Global optimum. I think a table would help here, kind of like high or low X variable makes low or high vir strategy the global optimum. I do not have my head around this yet. This may also be the paragraph for the invasion fitness vs solo fitness.
%p4 - virulence trait values move depending on phenology. (also a table)
%p5 - only one optimum in some conditions. (also a table)
%p6 - what does the trade-off do to the optima
%p7 - feed back and cycling.

%we need 3 tables for the bistability paper. Basically, variables make the rows and optima make the columns for all of them. Ex, a) increasing variable x increases or decreases vir trait value for each optimum. other 2 tables would be the same but b) which is the global optimum and c) which optimum goes away
Seasonal host activity drives both a monocyclic evolutionary optima and a polycyclic evolutionary optima separated by a repellor when parasites can complete multiple rounds of infection within a season (Figure 1). The monocylic strategy completes one round of infection per season by possessing a low virulence strategy that results in new parasite release close to the end of the season. The monocyclic strategy is adaptive because it minimizes environmental exposure of new progeny. The polycyclic strategy completes at least two rounds of infection per season by possessing a high virulence strategy. High virulence results in short periods between infection and new parasite release such that subsequent parasite generations have time to infect and release progeny before the end of the season. The optimal polycyclic strategy possesses a virulence level that releases the final generation of new parasites slightly before the end of the season. Parasites at the evolutionary repellor posess a moderate virulence level that falls between the virulence levels of the monocyclic and polycyclic optima. Moderate virulence parasites kill their host too quickly to minimize progeny decay in the environment but also do not kill hosts quickly enough to complete more than one round of infection during the season. The higher virulence, polycyclic strategy invade and replace populations of moderate virulence parasites by infecting remaining susceptible hosts before the second generation of moderate virulence parasites are released. Moderate virulence is thus a fitness minimum and an evolutionary repellor. The attractor that a population of parasites evolves towards is determined by their initial level of virulence, assuming mutation step sizes are small (Figure 2). The presence of an evolutionary repellor precludes evolutionary branching, \textit{i.e.} parasite populations will not evolve towards moderate virulence and branch into strains with distinct virulence strategies.

A polycyclic parasite's fitness (end of season equilibrium density) is not equivalent to its invasion fitness when rare. Polycyclic parasites with high virulence invade and replace lower virulence polycyclic parasites despite the fact that the lower virulence strain reaches a higher equilibrium density. High virulence polycyclic parasites invade by quickly killing hosts and releasing new parasites after infection. The second generation of the high virulence polycyclic parasites then infect remaining susceptible hosts before the lower virulence polycyclic strain with a higher equilibrium density. Polycyclic parasites evolve the maximum biologically possible level of virulence by invading and replacing lower virulence parasites when there is no trade-off between transmission and virulence (in this model we arbitrarily set maximum virulence to $\tau=1$). If there is a trade-off between transmission and virulence, the optimal virulence strategy balances the benefit of a competitive edge granted by high virulence with the cost of producing fewer new parasites per infection (see Figure 1).

Short seasons drive both the polycyclic and monocyclic optimums toward higher virulence (Figure 3). When seasons are short, there is less time between when parasites infect hosts at the beginning of the season and the end of the season. Thus short seasons select for higher virulence so that new monocyclic parasites are released shortly before the end of the season.
Similarly, higher virulence ensures enough time for multiple generations of infections for high virulence, polycyclic parasites. Short seasons thus drive the high virulence optimum towards higher virulence.

Short host emergence periods drive both the polycyclic and monocyclic optimums toward lower virulence (Figure 3). When the host emergence period is short, infections occur early in the season which drives both the polycyclic and monocyclic optimums towards lower virulence to position parasite-induced host death close to the end of the season. The strength of the impact of host emergence period length on parasite virulence for the two optima varies. When the host emergence period length is short, small increases in the emergence period drive large increases in virulence for the monocyclic optimum but only minor increases in virulence for the polycyclic optimum. In contrast, when the host emergence period is long, this trend is reversed: small increases in the emergence period drive negligible increases in virulence for the monocyclic optimum and large increases in virulence for the polycyclic optimum.

Environmental conditions, such as the length of the host emergence period, determine whether the monocyclic or polycyclic strategy is the global optimum (Figure 3). For example, the monocyclic strategy is the global optimum when the host emergence period is short. The fitness of the monocyclic strategy hinges on tight infection synchronization early in the season so that most new parasites are released near the end of the season. Monocyclic parasites thus reach high densities when the host emergence period is short. When the host emergence period is long, the polycyclic optimum is the global optimum instead. Infections are more spread out over time when the host emergence period is long. For the monocyclic strategy, asynchronous infections disrupt the ideally synchronous release of new parasites near the end of the season and instead results in many new parasites being released too early or not at all. By contrast, the polycyclic strategy is less reliant on perfect timing of early season infections. The progeny of polycyclic parasites that infect hosts early have time to complete another round of infection while the progeny of polycyclic parasites that infect hosts late are released close enough to the end of the season that not all decay in the environment. The polycyclic strategy is thus adaptive in environments with long host emergence periods.

Certain conditions destroy the bistability of evolutionary optima and instead preserve only one optimum (Figure 4). For example, there is no cost to remaining in the host for most of the season when host mortality is low. Few infections end from natural host mortality when host mortality is low which results in high parasite density. Incidence is high early in the season and there are few susceptible hosts available for a second generation of infections for high virulence parasites. Low virulence is thus the only viable evolutionary endpoint when host mortality is low. By contrast, when host mortality is high, it is beneficial to leave a host early who has a short life span. High virulence is thus the only viable evolutionary endpoint when host mortality is high.

A feedback between host demography and parasite fitness can generate periodic host-parasite dynamics as parasite virulence evolves (Figure 5). This qualitative change in dynamical behavior does not impact the result that either a polycyclic or monocyclic strategy evolves depending on the starting virulence level. However adaptation does proceed much more slowly when the dynamics are cycling.

\section*{Discussion}
Host phenological patterns govern parasite virulence and drive the evolution of diverse strategies. Host phenology drives parasites either towards a high virulence strategy that completes multiple rounds of infection within the season (polycyclic) or towards a low virulence strategy that completes one round of infection within the season (monocyclic). Both the monocyclic and polycyclic strategies are evolutionarily stable attractors across phenological patterns. In between the two attractors is an evolutionary repellor. Parasite populations thus evolve towards the polycyclic attractor if they start out more virulent than the evolutionary repellor or towards the monocyclic attractor if they start out less virulent than the repellor. The exact host phenological pattern also drives a diverse range of parasite strategies by determining optimal virulence for both the monocyclic and polycyclic attractors. While host seasonality did not drive evolutionary branching or the coexistence of diverse parasite strategies, these results predict that host seasonality could drive parasite diversity over geography.

The result that host seasonality drives parasites towards polycyclic or monocyclic evolutionary attractors provides clues on the evolutionary drivers of both strategies. The polycyclic strategy is potentially risky for parasites as it relies on there being enough susceptible hosts when later generations of parasites are released. The monocyclic strategy can be safer for parasites as it minimizes decay of new progeny in the environment, but only if the natural host mortality rate is low. Work by Hamelin et al. showed that host seasonality can drive coexistence between monocylic and polycyclic strategies if parasite evolution is constrained by a trade-off between within-season transmission and between-season surival\cite{hamelin2011seasonality}. The monocyclic strategy has high between-season survival at the cost of low transmission during the season while the polycyclic strategy transmits to many new hosts within the season at the cost of low between-season survival. Our results are driven by the timing of parasite release rather than an explicit trade-off which is predicted to drive evolutionary bistability rather than coexistence between polycyclic and  monocyclic strategies. Nevertheless, our results and Hamelin et al. have some similarities in that the monocyclic strategy evolves to decrease the impact of environmental exposure while the polycyclic strategy evolves to increase new infections.

Environmental conditions aside from host phenology can also determine whether the polycyclic or monocyclic strategy has a competitive edge. For example, the monocyclic strategy is the  global optimum in environments with low parasite decay rates. Low decay rates allow parasites to reach high parasite densities. When parasite densities are high, infection incidence is high early in the season which drives synchronous release of new parasites near the end of the season. Thus environments with low decay rates are predicted to select for low virulence monocyclic parasites. This result deviates from the ``Curse of the Pharoah'' hypothesis which predicts that parasites with low environmental decay rates select for high virulence as leaving the host early poses little risk for parasites\cite{}. In contrast, the polycyclic strategy is the global optimum in environments where remaining in the host is risky, such as when hosts have a high natural mortality rate. Environments where host life expectancy is short are thus predicted to drive the evolution of high virulence polycyclic parasites. This result is in line with previous theory that predicts high host mortality drives the evolution of high virulence\cite{Anderson1982,Lenski1994,Gandon2001,Cooper2002}.

%discuss previous work
High parasite densities can drive cyclic host-parasite dynamics when the host population at the end of a given season produces the emerging host cohort the following season. Cycling does not qualitatively alter the result that either monocyclic or polycyclic parasite strategies evolve. These results are in line with previous work on a strictly monocyclic parasite where high parasite density drives cycling and cycling does not alter evolutionary endpoints when compared to a model without cycling\cite{macdonald2021host}. While we could not solve the current model analytically, previous work on the similar model suggested that cycles are driven by a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation which is likely the case in the current model. In the current model, cycling host-parasite dynamics could drive high virulence parasites extinct while maintaining low virulence parasite populations. Polycyclic parasites periodically have extremely low densities after reaching densities that drive cycling (Figure 5). Polycyclic strategies complete more rounds of infection within the season and are thus more exploitative of host populations. After the polycyclic strategy has driven dramatic decreases in host populations, there are not enough hosts to infect which drives parasite density to low levels. In nature, these polycyclic parasite populations would be at high risk for stochastic extinction. In contrast, when parasite populations evolve towards low virulence and drive cycling, their densities remain high throughout the cycle. Thus in nature, high virulence parasites may be more likely to die out when cycling while low virulence parasites maintain safe densities that persist when cycling.

%is there lit on similar parasites exhibiting opposite latency strategies? results could explain why similar geographic locations have very different parasite populations. maybe also look at lit on repellors to see if there are any pop gen refs on randomness of which mutation arises
%some wasps are more likely to be monocyclic at high altitudes (where seasons are shorter), could be that minimum latency period is too long to complete more than one parasite generation. in contrast, at lower altitudes similar/same(?) wasp species are more likely to be bicyclic
%propose experiments?
%The seasonal activity patterns of species with non-overlapping generations may have large impacts on the virulence strategies of the parasites they host. For example, ichneumonid parasitic wasp species are more likely to be monocylic at high altitudes and bicyclic or polycyclic at low altitudes. This observation has some similarities with our results. The model predicts that short seasons drive higher virulence for both evolutionary attractors. There are likely constraints on the minimum time between infection and progeny release.

%extensions
%what happens when host populations are less limited? (I expect high virulence takes over) - discuss self-shading result here, if hosts reproduce more than once per season, high virulence might be a better strategy because self-shading maybe isn't as big of a problem
%what happens when some hosts survive between seasons, could this cause branching?
Several features of the current model can be altered to investigate more complex impacts of phenology on virulence evolution and parasite diversity. For example, relaxing the assumption that host populations reproduce once per season would likely favor the high virulence strategy. In the current model, the first generation of high virulence parasites in a season self-shades by killing too many hosts which results in few hosts remaining for the next generation of parasites to infect. Host reproduction throughout the season may reduce or eliminate the cost of self-shading and thus select for higher virulence. %Additionally, a host species that lives through several seasons could qualitatively change evolutionary endpoints by increasing selection for high virulence during the host activity period and low virulence after the host activity period. This extension could drive evolutionary branching in parasite virulence strategies.
We will extend the current model to address this question in future studies.

%caveats
The strict assumption that the parasites is an obligate host-killer can likely be relaxed without altering the result that phenology can drive the evolution of stable monocyclic or polycyclic strategies. For example, many parasites reduce host fecundity or increase the host death rate upon progeny release. Longer latency periods are equivalent to lower virulence in this type of system as infected hosts have more time to reproduce and thus higher fitness. Relaxing the obligate-killer assumption would not likely alter our results qualitatively as the same evolutionary pressures would act on the timing of parasite release. That is, releasing new parasites quickly (high virulence) or releasing parasites near the end of the season (low virulence) would likely both be viable strategies. Many parasite-host systems conform to the assumptions of this model extension such as soil-borne plant pathogens, demicyclic rusts, post-harvest diseases, and many diseases systems infecting univoltine insects\cite{gaulin2007root,zehr1982control,crowell1934hosts,holuvsa2017pathogen}.
